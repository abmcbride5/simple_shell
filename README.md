# simple_shell

  * sh - a command programming language that executes commands read from a terminal or a file. 
    In this final project for the trimester, me and Amber McBride will code a "simple shell" from scratch.
    This includes different functions, elements, variables and many other working parts to make this happen.
    This project will allow us to have a better understanding on the Shell. Something we will be using the rest
    of our lives.

**Resources**

Read or watch:

     * Unix shell
     * Thompson shell
     * Ken Thompson
     * Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell


man or help:

* sh (Run sh as well)
* Learning Objectives
* At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
* Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
* Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
* Who is Ken Thompson
* How does a shell work
* What is a pid and a ppid
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process
* What is the difference between a function and a system call
* How to create processes
* What are the three prototypes of main
* How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
* How to execute another program with the execve system call
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
* What is EOF / “end-of-file”?


**General Requiremnts:**

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your C programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* No more than 5 functions per file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* Use system calls only when you need to (why?)
